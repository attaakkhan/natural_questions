### Baseline for NQ
---
This repo contains two baselines for NQ.

- BERT baseline: `language/question_answering/bert_joint`
- Deccat-Docreader baseline: `language/question_answering/decatt_docreader`

Please use Python2 for these two programs. Before starting, you should run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies.

If you can access [ASU Agave](https://cores.research.asu.edu/research-computing/user-guide), the sbatch scripts in `language/question_answering/bert_joint/agave` may help you.
