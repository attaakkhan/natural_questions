<h3>-7855437198803764135 Lithium</h3><h3>what is the main mineral in lithium batteries</h3><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> Lithium ( from Greek : λίθος , translit . lithos , lit . ' stone ' ) is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3 . It is a soft , silvery - white alkali metal . Under standard conditions , it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element . Like all alkali metals , lithium is highly reactive and flammable , and is stored in mineral oil . When cut open , it exhibits a metallic luster , but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray , then black tarnish . It never occurs freely in nature , but only in ( usually ionic ) compounds , such as pegmatitic minerals which were once the main source of lithium . Due to its solubility as an ion , it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines . Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> Late in the 20th century , lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes , because of its high electrode potential . Because of its low atomic mass , it has a high charge - and power - to - weight ratio . A typical lithium - ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell , compared with 2.1 volts for lead - acid or 1.5 volts for zinc - carbon cells . Lithium - ion batteries , which are rechargeable and have a high energy density , should not be confused with lithium batteries , which are disposable ( primary ) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode . Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium - ion polymer battery , lithium iron phosphate battery , and the nanowire battery . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> Thunderstorms can form and develop in any geographic location but most frequently within the mid-latitude , where warm , moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes . Thunderstorms are responsible for the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena . Thunderstorms , and the phenomena that occur along with them , pose great hazards . Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds , large hailstones , and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation . Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> David Francis Dravecky ( born February 14 , 1956 ) is an American former professional baseball player , a motivational speaker , and an author . He played Major League Baseball for the San Diego Padres ( 1982 -- 87 ) and San Francisco Giants ( 1987 -- 89 ) . Cancer ended his career as his team was reaching the 1989 World Series . He won the Hutch Award in 1989 . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> The following season , a cancerous desmoid tumor was found in Dravecky 's pitching arm . On October 7 , 1988 , he underwent surgery , which removed half of the deltoid muscle in his pitching arm and froze the humerus bone in an effort to eliminate all of the cancerous cells . Doctors advised Dravecky to wait until 1990 to pitch again , but Dravecky was determined to pitch in 1989 . By July 1989 , he was pitching in the minors , and on August 10 , he made a highly publicized return to the major leagues , pitching eight innings and defeating Cincinnati 4 -- 3 . In his following start , five days later in Montreal , Dravecky pitched three no - hit innings , but in the fifth inning , he felt a tingling sensation in his arm . In the sixth inning , he started off shaky , allowing a home run to the leadoff batter and then hitting the second batter , Andrés Galarraga . Then , on his first pitch to Tim Raines , his humerus bone snapped ; the sound of it breaking could be heard throughout the stadium . Dravecky collapsed on the mound . He 'd suffered a clean break midway between his shoulder and elbow , ending his season . </P></div><br>

<h3>761079737280110147 Strategy of unbalanced growth</h3><h3>who has given the theory of unbalanced economic growth</h3><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> Unbalanced growth is a natural path of economic development . Situations that countries are in at any one point in time reflect their previous investment decisions and development . Accordingly , at any point in time desirable investment programs that are not balanced investment packages may still advance welfare . Unbalanced investment can complement or correct existing imbalances . Once such an investment is made , a new imbalance is likely to appear , requiring further compensating investments . Therefore , growth need not take place in a balanced way . Supporters of the unbalanced growth doctrine include Albert O. Hirschman , Hans Singer , Paul Streeten , Marcus Fleming , Prof. Rostov and J. Sheehan . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> The theory is generally associated with Hirschman . He presented a complete theoretical formulation of the strategy . Underdeveloped countries display common characteristics : low levels of GNI per capita and slow GNI per capita growth , large income inequalities and widespread poverty , low levels of productivity , great dependence on agriculture , a backward industrial structure , a high proportion of consumption and low savings , high rates of population growth and dependency burdens , high unemployment and underemployment , technological backwardness and dualism ( existence of both traditional and modern sectors ) . In a less - developed country , these characteristics lead to scarce resources or inadequate infrastructure to exploit these resources . With a lack of investors and entrepreneurs , cash flows can not be directed into various sectors that influence balanced economic growth . </P></div><br>

<h3>-8463303168185775472 List of Tom and Jerry characters</h3><h3>what's the dog's name on tom and jerry</h3><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> Tom ( named `` Jasper '' in his debut appearance ) is a grey and white domestic shorthair cat . `` Tom '' is a generic name for a male cat . He is usually but not always , portrayed as living a comfortable , or even pampered life , while Jerry ( named `` Jinx '' in his debut appearance ) is a small , brown , house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom . Despite being very energetic , determined and much larger , Tom is no match for Jerry 's wits . Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size , approximately the equivalent of Tom 's , lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts . Although cats typically chase mice to consume them , it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to consume Jerry . Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry , sometimes in revenge , and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry . By the final `` fade - out '' of each cartoon , Jerry usually emerges triumphant , while Tom is shown as the loser . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> Spike , occasionally referred to as Butch or Killer , is a stern but occasionally dumb American bulldog who is particularly disapproving of cats , but a softie when it comes to mice ( though in his debut appearance , Dog Trouble , Spike goes after both Tom and Jerry ) , and later , his son Tyke . In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo - in for a beating from the bulldog . Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon : his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness . He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble , and his first speaking role was in 1944 's The Bodyguard , where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949 , from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler . Unlike his father Spike , Tyke does not speak . He only communicates by yapping , whimpering , growling , facial expressions and wagging his tail . In Tom and Jerry Kids , Tyke does have a speaking role in the program and is the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak . Spike is very protective towards his son and gets very angry at Tom if Tyke is bothered or harmed . Although Tyke has spoken in Tom and Jerry Kids , he has laughed in one Tom and Jerry short . After Daws Butler , Maurice LaMarche , Frank Welker , John DiMaggio , Michael Donovan , Phil LaMarr and currently Rick Zieff would all perform Spike 's voice . Tyke 's vocal effects are provided by Frank Welker and speaking roles by Patric Zimmerman . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> The bond is a debt security , under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and ( depending on the terms of the bond ) is obliged to pay them interest ( the coupon ) or to repay the principal at a later date , termed the maturity date . Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals ( semiannual , annual , sometimes monthly ) . Very often the bond is negotiable , that is , the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market . This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond , it is highly liquid on the secondary market . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , often shortened to Hamlet ( / ˈhæmlɪt / ) , is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare at an uncertain date between 1599 and 1602 . Set in Denmark , the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle , Claudius , by the ghost of Hamlet 's father , King Hamlet . Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne , also marrying his deceased brother 's widow . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> The story of Shakespeare 's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth , preserved by 13th - century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum , as subsequently retold by the 16th - century scholar François de Belleforest . Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur - Hamlet , though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur - Hamlet , later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have . He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> In meteorology , the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic , Pacific , and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America , Southeast Asia , and Madagascar and eastern Africa , respectively . Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea , as well as portions of southeastern North America . Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes , and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion , which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge . The weaker the trade winds become , the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> Amplitude modulation is the simplest type and the most commonly used for shortwave broadcasting . The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal ( speech , or music , for example ) . At the receiver , a simple detector recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave radio frequencies . There is no official definition of the band , but the range always includes all of the high frequency band ( HF ) , and generally extends from 1.7 -- 30 MHz ( 176.3 -- 10.0 m ) ; from the high end of the medium frequency band ( MF ) just above the mediumwave AM broadcast band , to the end of the HF band . </P></div><br>

The film has a cult following in fans of the original song . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <Ul> <Li> Barbara Eden as Stella Johnson , a widowed cosmetics salesperson with a young daughter , whose joie de vivre , her principles , and her individuality anger most of the powerful people in town and on the Parent Teachers Association board . She inevitably becomes PTA president after embarrassing Flora , the snobby former President and her equally snobby friends . </Li> <Li> Ronny Cox as Willis `` Will '' Newton , a wealthy member of the PTA who does n't agree with Flora and her snobby allies and is in love with Stella . He and Stella get married at the end of the movie . </Li> <Li> Nanette Fabray as Alice Finley , Stella 's best friend and co-conspirator against the snobs of Harper Valley . She owns and operates the La Moderne Beauty Shop . </Li> <Li> Louis Nye as Kirby Baker , a local real estate agent who is allied with Flora and her friends . Notorious for being a lecherous playboy and infamous for impregnating his secretaries , one of whom , Gladys Wilmot , left town to see an abortionist in Cincinnati . As part of a plan to discredit Stella , he tries to foreclose on Stella 's house , which infuriates her . He then gets arrested and jailed for attacking Myrna Wong , a friend of Stella 's , who rebuffs his advances , throwing him by use of martial arts and destroying the office . </Li> <Li> John Fiedler as Bobby Taylor , a man on the PTA who lusts after Stella . Overly dominated by his wife , Holly . Although open to allow Stella to speak , he is not above having a fellow PTA board member kidnapped to commit election fraud . He was arrested for indecent exposure after being set up by Stella . </Li> <Li> Ron Masak as Herbie Maddox , the head bartender at Kelly 's bar , and Stella 's ally against Flora and her friends . He has a crush on Stella , and is one of her friends . </Li> <Li> Clint Howard as Corley , a young delivery person , who works for the local florist shop , who brings Stella flowers from Will . </Li> <Li> Susan Swift as Dee Johnson , Stella 's 14 - year - old daughter , who is threatened with expulsion from school if her mother does n't conform to the way the PTA wants her to behave . She has a hand in assisting her mother and Alice with one of their revenge schemes . She loses her braces , gets a makeover , and ends up with a boyfriend , Carlyle . </Li> <Li> Pat Paulsen as Otis Harper , the descendant of the founding family of Harper Valley . A PTA member who is allied with Flora and her friends . Has a tendency to drink all the time , which annoys his wife , Bertha . He had a stampede of elephants , painted pink , stormed through his house , destroying it . </Li> <Li> Amzie Strickland as Shirley Thompson , a member of the PTA board who tends to drink a lot of gin . Though she is allied with Flora and her friends , she is one of four PTA members ( Will , Skeeter and Holly Taylor are the others ) who are spared any retribution from Stella . She was seen as the most sympathetic of the board , as she tended to be more manipulated as opposed to being manipulative . It was never revealed whether or not she retained her seat on the PTA , but it is presumed that she became more sympathetic towards Stella as she was seen waving goodbye at Olive as she was being arrested . </Li> <Li> Bob Hastings as Skeeter Duggan , a member of the PTA board , and the town 's Notary public who is sympathetic to Stella . He is kidnapped by Dutch and Tex at Flora Simpson Reilly 's orders . </Li> <Li> Audrey Christie as Flora Simpson - Reilly , The movie 's main antagonist . She is the pompous and extremely snobbish president of the PTA board who thoroughly despises Stella ( who defeats her for president at the end of the movie ) and all she stands for . So desperate is she to retain her power and prestige in the community that she has a fellow member of the PTA ( Skeeter Duggan ) kidnapped so she and her allies can commit election fraud . She is embarrassed when her permanent set is destroyed by a hair depilatory at the beauty salon . </Li> <Li> Molly Dodd as Olive Glover , the recording secretary of the PTA who is a gambling addict . Clearly the most corrupt and most vindictive member of the PTA board , she is eventually arrested for embezzlement after having a load of hay and horse manure dumped on top of her . She is the one who initially angers Stella by sending her the letter denouncing her , and tries to get Dee 's friend , Mavis , arrested for embezzlement . </Li> <Li> Fay DeWitt as Willamae Jones , a snide biology teacher at the junior high school who is also a member of the PTA . She makes no secret of the fact that she favors the Reilly twins , due to the connections between her and Flora . Notorious for being a nymphomaniac ( though she hides it under a prim - and - proper façade ) , she is caught in flagrante delicto with Barney Crunk , the town 's mailman , on film . </Li> <Li> DeVera Marcus as Holly Taylor , Bobby 's obviously overbearing wife , who tends to drink a lot when Bobby is out of town , and does n't approve of Bobby 's lusting , or of anything else he does ( this is different from the character in the song , who `` seems to use a lot of ice whenever ( her husband ) 's away '' , implying adultery with the iceman ) . However , despite her ties to Flora and her scheming friends , she , like Shirley Thompson , is spared any retribution from Stella , due to Stella refusing to date Bobby . </Li> <Li> Louise Foley as Mavis , Dee Johnson 's best friend , who is nearly framed for a crime she did not commit by the vindictive Olive Glover . </Li> <Li> Brian Cook as Carlyle , a popular track star who chooses Dee , after she gets a makeover , and angers Bettina Reilly in the process . </Li> <Li> Laura Teige as Bettina Reilly , One of Flora 's twin granddaughters , who wants to be with Carlyle , and is jealous when he chooses Dee over her .

He is caught in flagrante delicto on film with Willamae Jones . </Li> <Li> Royce D. Applegate as Dutch , one of two kidnappers who abduct Skeeter Duggan at Flora Simpson - Reilly 's orders . </Li> <Li> J.J. Barry as Tex , the mastermind of the kidnap plot to get Skeeter Duggan out of the way so Flora Simpson - Reilly and her friends could commit election fraud . He and his accomplice Dutch are arrested and the two of them rat out Flora and her friends on their scheme . </Li> <Li> Pitt Herbert as Henry Reilly , Flora 's overly dominated husband and grandfather to Edwina and Bettina . Henry is wealthy , but is very weak - willed and is known for acquiescing to his wife 's schemes . </Li> <Li> Arlen Stuart as Bertha Harper , wife of Otis Harper , who gets annoyed by her husband 's continual drinking . She is terrified when her house is destroyed by pink - painted elephants . </Li> </Ul></div><br>

<h3>-4752044886865067782 Cyrus Cylinder</h3><h3>who wrote the first declaration of human rights</h3><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> The Cyrus Cylinder ( Persian : استوانه کوروش ‎ , translit . Ostovane - ye Kūrosh ) or Cyrus Charter ( منشور کوروش Manshūre Kūrosh ) is an ancient clay cylinder , now broken into several pieces , on which is written a declaration in Akkadian cuneiform script in the name of Persia 's Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great . It dates from the 6th century BC and was discovered in the ruins of Babylon in Mesopotamia ( modern Iraq ) in 1879 . It is currently in the possession of the British Museum , which sponsored the expedition that discovered the cylinder . It was created and used as a foundation deposit following the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BC , when the Neo-Babylonian Empire was invaded by Cyrus and incorporated into his Persian Empire . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> The Cylinder 's text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus ' policy of the repatriation of the Jewish people following their Babylonian captivity ( an act that the Book of Ezra attributes to Cyrus ) , as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples . This interpretation has been disputed , as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries , and makes no mention of Jews , Jerusalem , or Judea . The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights , a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder 's generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign . Neil MacGregor , Director of the British Museum , has stated that the cylinder was `` the first attempt we know about running a society , a state with different nationalities and faiths -- a new kind of statecraft . '' It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire . On October 14 , the Mohammad Reza Shah 's sister , Princess Ashraf Pahlavi , presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder . The princess asserted that `` the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding , tolerance , courage , compassion and , above all , human liberty '' . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times . The Forty - Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights A new provision , Article 300 - A , was added to the constitution , which provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law '' . Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property , there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation . The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32 . Thus , the right to property is no longer a fundamental right , though it is still a constitutional right . If the government appears to have acted unfairly , the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> As a young woman , Rogue permanently absorbed the superhuman powers and the psyche of Carol Danvers , the original Ms. Marvel . This provided her with superhuman strength , stamina , durability , reflexes , speed and a 7th sense . She was able to repel bullets and fly at sub-sonic speeds , much like Ms. Marvel could . In addition , she possessed an amalgamated mutant human / Kree physiology that rendered her resistant to most toxins and poisons , with the added effect of making her virtually invulnerable . </P></div><br>

                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">pred_answer: <P> The Dead Sea is an endorheic lake located in the Jordan Rift Valley , a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform ( DST ) . This left lateral - moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate . It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai . It is here that the Upper Jordan River / Sea of Galilee / Lower Jordan River water system comes to an end . </P></div><br>
                    <div style="border: 3px solid grey">true_answer: <P> The Dead Sea ( Hebrew : יָם הַמֶּלַח ‬ Yam ha - Melah lit . Sea of Salt ; Arabic : البحر الميت ‎ Al - Bahr al - Mayyit ) is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and Palestine to the west . Its surface and shores are 430.5 metres ( 1,412 ft ) below sea level , Earth 's lowest elevation on land . The Dead Sea is 304 m ( 997 ft ) deep , the deepest hypersaline lake in the world . With a salinity of 342 g / kg , or 34.2 % , ( in 2011 ) , it is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean and one of the world 's saltiest bodies of water . This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals can not flourish , hence its name . The Dead Sea is 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) long and 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) wide at its widest point . It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley , and its main tributary is the Jordan River . </P></div><br>
